      <description>Disclaimer: Actual GFS paper is a must read and is easy to follow, blog is only a summary intended for self motivation and checkpointing.

Distributed File system(DFS) is a distributed implementation of file system which implies there are more entities involved like more machines, network etc which brings additional complexities, but the aim is to make it look like a file system on single server.</description>
