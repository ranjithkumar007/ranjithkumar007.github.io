      <description>Disclaimer: Actual GFS paper is a must read, blog is only a summary intended for self motivation and checkpointing.
File system controls storage and retireval of data. Distributed File system(DFS) is a distributed implementation of file system which implies there are more entities involved like more machines, network etc which brings additional complexities, but the aim is to make it look like a file system on single server.
Design goals of DFS include scalability, high availability, fault tolerance, network transparency(ex: NFS mount makes remote file access transparent), trading off between consistency and performance etc.</description>
